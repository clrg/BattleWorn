# BattleWorn

*A violent beginning.*

"Commander, the troops tire and defeat looks inevitable, what are your orders?" Galright is your 2nd in command, and his words weigh heavily on your mind.

You survey the landscape intently. You know you are exposed on the dry lifeless plain on which your army is stationed. Your allies were supposed to have signalled you by now, a fact that weighs heavily on your senior soldiers who look increasingly concerned. To the east lies the mountains from which the dwarves were supposed to emerge, to the west the elvish forces were supposed to be stationed amongst the trees. Neither ally has been true to their word, a treachery that will not be forgotten.

On the horizon the banners of the horde are shrouded in the dust being kicked up by an army so vast that it churns the stomach just thinking about the fight to come. The fear in the eyes of the your men is palpable but you know you can not let them see you feel the same. Behind your ranks is the distant outline of the rocky marshes beyond which lies Adril's Gate, the giant fortress keeping the kingdom of men safe from the savage orcs that roam the plains north of the wasteland that bridges our lands.

One of your senior soldiers loses his discipline and snaps, "We should never've trusted those treacherous dwarves, nor those cowardly elves!"

Galright grabs him, "Watch your tongue, soldier. That's your King you are addressing."

You know now is not the time to enforce decorum, "Be calm Galright, now is not the time to turn on each other. We barely held Adril's Gate against a much smaller force than the one that marches on us today. We needed the dwarvern artillery and the elven arrows, as well as the advantage of out flanking the enemy from both sides."

Galright speaks his mind, "But the Great Forged Door remains sealed and the forrests at the birth of the river remain empty. With all due respect, my liege, they have lead us to our deaths. We will never make it back to the gate in time."

An elven voice speaks up, "Not all of us, but maybe we can use their numbers against them."

Galright almost smiles, "Ah, I'd almost forgotten some elves have balls. Welcome Duodrin." The old friends embrace.

Duodrin embraces you before explaining, "The undead forces to the north west are massing. The Council of Elves has moved our forces in that direction as there is not the natural protection that the great rivers afford us against the orcs. I have brought as many with me as I could, perhaps 300."

You know the seriousness of the undead threat, even if your men do not appreciate it so. Galright scoffs, "So how do we survive this day so that we can defend your kind for you?"

Duodrin looks at you, and knows you are thinking the same thing, then says to Galright, "300 elves are a lot but not on the plains or trees where we'd be quickly overwhelmed. However, in the mountain passes to the east, 300 elven bowmen would be lethal to the thickest of hides." Galright nods, he knows first hand the famed accuracy of the elvish bow.

You take over, "Right, we need to narrow their forces and isolate their strength." Your advisors look puzzled as you continue, "So we must move the battle away from these open plains. Galright, have the heavy cavalry remove the army from the horses but keep the colours. Just as the dust obscures their forces, we can use it to cover the retreat of our main forces."

Galright's expression starts to brighten as he realises the plan. "Which of our forces do we take to the pass, sire?"

You focus your thoughts, "Enough not to hold up our passage to suitable vantage point, yet not too few as to give the orcs reason to doubt." You know the bloodthirsty greenskins will follow as they thirst for battle as long as they believe your forces head through the valley leading to the mountain passes, "Sound the horns Galright, time is of the essence!"
